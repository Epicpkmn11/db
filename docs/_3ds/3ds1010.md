  It''s like Tetris but with infinite time, you lose when you can no longer place
  any of the pieces you have available.'

update_notes: '<p>Hello! With this new release, I consider the game complete.<br>

  Saving, Themes, Good (enough) controls, Great UI, all is there. There might be a
  few bugs to fix as people find them, but features are finished.</p>

  <p>This release adds better themes: text color control, and a banner.<br>

  The different colors of the pieces needed more space on the save so download and
  run the saveconverter for your OS, otherwise the game will crash when you launch
  it.</p>

  <p>You can make your own themes simply by changing the colors in the colors.txt,
  and the images in sprites.png, then find a name for your theme and put the files
  in /3ds/3ds1010/Themes//</p>'
